(Algorithms and program development for biological chemistry)

This git repository serves as platform for information, sharing course material, communication and submission of course work.

Students of the class shall work on different assignments and ---finally--- on a team project. The assignments are generally described in README files in the subdirectories A'n'; submission is generally done via git/GitHub.

The warm up assignment in subdirectory A0 demos this scheme and explains the submission via GitHub (including preparations). Follow this assignment to get started.

Feel free to discuss via pull request comments (in particular, assignment specific stuff) or GitHub issues for all more general things. Don't forget to mention the people you want to address (e.g. @mtw for me or @TBIAPBC/APBC2022 for all).
